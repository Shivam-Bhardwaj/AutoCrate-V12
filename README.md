## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows (primary support)
- Siemens NX (for CAD model generation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivam-Bhardwaj/AutoCrate-V12.git
   cd AutoCrate-V12
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python autocrate/nx_expressions_generator.py
   ```

### Building Executable

To create a standalone executable with full testing:

```bash
build_and_test.bat
```

This runs:
1. **Quick Tests** - 5-second validation of core functionality
2. **PyInstaller Build** - Creates standalone executable (2-3 minutes)  
3. **Executable Validation** - Tests the built application

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory.

## How It Works

AutoCrate follows a sophisticated workflow to generate complete crate designs:

### 1. Input Specifications
- Product dimensions (length × width × height)
- Product weight
- Clearance requirements
- Material specifications

### 2. Intelligent Design Calculations
- **Skid Sizing**: Determines lumber size (4×4, 4×6, etc.) based on load requirements
- **Panel Optimization**: Calculates optimal plywood layouts to minimize waste
- **Structural Analysis**: Places reinforcing cleats per engineering standards
- **Dimensional Stability**: Iteratively adjusts dimensions to account for material thickness

### 3. Output Generation
- **NX Expressions File** (`.exp`): Parametric data for Siemens NX CAD model
- **Manufacturing Data**: Complete bill of materials and cut lists
- **3D Visualization**: Automatic generation of detailed CAD models
