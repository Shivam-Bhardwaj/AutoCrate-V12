# - Setup and deploy? Y
# - Which scope? (select your account)
# - Link to existing project? N (first time) or Y (updates)
# - Project name? autocrate-v12
# - Directory? ./ (current)
# - Override settings? N
```

### Step 3: Configure Production Environment
```bash
# Set production environment variable
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL production

# Enter your Railway URL when prompted:
# https://autocrate-api-production.up.railway.app/api
```

## **PART 3: Final Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è

### Update CORS in Railway
```bash
# Go back to API directory
