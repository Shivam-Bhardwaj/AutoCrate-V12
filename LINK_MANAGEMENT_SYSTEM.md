- Color-coded test results (green/yellow/red)
- Detailed failure reporting with actionable recommendations
- Live demo section with sample disabled/enabled features

## Implementation Details

### Component Integration

**Updated Components**:
- **Navbar.tsx**: All navigation links now use managed system with appropriate disabled states
- **ResultsPanel.tsx**: Export buttons managed with professional tooltips explaining availability
- **BOMPanel.tsx**: Export functions properly disabled with development timelines
- **Viewer3D.tsx**: Added export controls with managed disabled states
- **Calculator.tsx**: Quick test presets and calculation features properly managed

### Configuration Management

The system uses a centralized configuration approach where each interactive element has a unique ID and comprehensive metadata:

```typescript
{
  id: 'feature-identifier',
  label: 'User-friendly name',
  isEnabled: boolean,
  tooltip: 'Helpful description',
  reason: 'Detailed explanation for disabled state',
  estimatedCompletion: 'Q1 2025',
  priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
}
```

### Professional User Experience

**Disabled Feature Handling**:
- Clear visual indication with appropriate opacity and cursor changes
- Informative tooltips explaining why features are disabled
- Estimated completion dates for user planning
- Priority indicators showing development importance
- Graceful degradation without breaking user workflows

**Error Prevention**:
- Automatic prevention of clicks on disabled elements
- Form submission blocking for incomplete features
- Navigation prevention to non-existent routes
- Clear feedback for all user interactions

## Technical Architecture

### Context Pattern
- Single source of truth for all link states
- Provider pattern ensures availability throughout component tree
- Efficient state updates with minimal re-renders
- Type-safe configuration with TypeScript interfaces

### Hook-Based API
- `useLinkStatus()`: Access to global link management state
- `useLink(linkId)`: Individual link state with helper properties
- `useMultipleLinks([ids])`: Batch access for component optimization
- `useLinkDetection()`: Automated scanning functionality

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading of detection utilities
