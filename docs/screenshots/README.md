# AutoCrate Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots and images used in the project documentation.

## Required Screenshots

To complete the documentation, please add the following screenshots:

### 1. Main GUI Interface (`autocrate-gui-main.png`)
- Screenshot of the main AutoCrate application window
- Should show the input fields, buttons, and overall layout
- Recommended size: 1200x800 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparent background where possible

### 2. Design Workflow Diagram (`design-workflow.png`)
- Visual representation of the AutoCrate design process
- Should show the flow from input → calculation → output
- Can be created as a flowchart or infographic
- Recommended size: 1000x600 pixels

### 3. Crate Components Diagram (`crate-components.png`)
- Technical diagram showing crate structural components
- Should label: panels, cleats, skids, plywood sheets
- Can be a 3D rendering or technical drawing
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels

### 4. Results Output (`autocrate-results.png`)
- Screenshot showing AutoCrate's output results
- Should include generated expressions file or 3D model view
- Can be a split view showing both text output and 3D model
- Recommended size: 1200x700 pixels

## Screenshot Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: PNG preferred (supports transparency)
- **Resolution**: High resolution for clarity (at least 150 DPI)
- **Compression**: Optimize for web while maintaining quality
- **Naming**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)

### Content Guidelines
- **Clean Interface**: Hide or blur any sensitive information
- **Representative Data**: Use realistic but non-proprietary examples
- **Professional Quality**: Ensure screenshots are clear and well-composed
- **Consistent Styling**: Maintain consistent UI theme across screenshots

### Capture Instructions

#### For GUI Screenshots:
1. Run the AutoCrate application
2. Set up a typical use case (e.g., 36×24×18 inch crate)
3. Ensure the window is properly sized and positioned
4. Use Windows Snipping Tool or similar for clean captures
5. Save as PNG with descriptive filename

#### For Diagrams:
1. Use professional diagramming tools (Visio, Draw.io, etc.)
2. Follow the project's color scheme (blues and grays)
3. Include clear labels and annotations
4. Export as high-resolution PNG

## Updating Documentation

After adding screenshots, update the following files:
- `README.md` - Verify image paths are correct
- `docs/index.html` - Add images to the HTML documentation if desired

## Alternative Text

Ensure all images have appropriate alt text for accessibility:
- `autocrate-gui-main.png`: "AutoCrate's intuitive user interface for crate design"
- `design-workflow.png`: "AutoCrate's intelligent design workflow" 
- `crate-components.png`: "Detailed view of crate structural components"
- `autocrate-results.png`: "Example of AutoCrate's comprehensive output including 3D model and technical drawings"
