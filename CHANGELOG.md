  - Fixed console encoding issues in Windows Command Prompt
  - Ensured all test output works correctly across Windows versions

### Technical Achievements
- **100% Test Pass Rate**: All automated tests passing consistently
- **Sub-millisecond Performance**: Average 0.13-0.28ms per calculation
- **Complete ASTM Validation**: All compliance tests passing (D6256 standards)
- **Engineering-Grade Testing**: Property-based testing with boundary condition validation
- **Production-Ready Pipeline**: Complete CI/CD system from source to executable

## [12.0.6] - 2025-07-31

### Added
- **Quick Test Suite Button**: Added new "Quick Test Suite" button to GUI for rapid testing of corner cases and edge scenarios
  - Generates 10 test cases covering various product dimensions and edge conditions
  - Includes the original horizontal splice bug test case (20x20x100)
  - Test cases include: very tall/thin, standard plywood sizes, large/heavy, small/light, maximum size, perfect cube, etc.
  - Creates `quick_test_expressions/` folder with descriptive filenames
  - Uses current GUI settings for material parameters
  - Provides detailed progress logging and success/failure summary
  - Useful for regression testing and validating fixes across different scenarios

## [12.0.5] - 2025-07-31

### Changed
- **Project Structure Consolidation**: Consolidated dual codebase structure to eliminate confusion between `legacy/` and `src/` folders
  - Moved all working code from `legacy/` to main `autocrate/` folder
  - Removed incomplete `src/autocrate/` refactor attempt that had import issues
  - Updated build system to use `autocrate/nx_expressions_generator.py` as entry point
  - Updated all test imports to use `autocrate.` module paths
  - All 78 tests pass with new consolidated structure
  - Single source of truth for easier maintenance and development

## [12.0.4] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed
- **Expressions File Location**: Fixed issue where .exp files were being saved to temp folder instead of intended location. Expressions are now saved to `expressions/` folder in the same directory as the executable for easier access and organization.
  - Modified path detection logic to use executable directory when running as built application
  - Added proper distinction between script mode and executable mode
  - Ensures expressions are always saved alongside the executable for better user experience

## [12.0.3] - 2025-07-31

### Fixed
- **Horizontal Splice Cleat Bug**: Fixed critical issue where horizontal plywood splices were not getting proper cleat support when panels had no intermediate vertical cleats. This occurred with unusual product dimensions (e.g., 20x20x100 - very tall but thin products). The fix ensures all horizontal splices receive structural support per ASTM requirements, regardless of vertical cleat configuration.
  - Modified `calculate_horizontal_cleat_sections` to create cleat sections even when no intermediate vertical cleats exist
  - Updated conditional logic in `nx_expressions_generator.py` to properly trigger horizontal cleat recalculation
  - Applied fix across all panel types (Front, Back, Left, Right, Top)

## [12.0.2] - Previous Release
- Major refactor and cleanup
