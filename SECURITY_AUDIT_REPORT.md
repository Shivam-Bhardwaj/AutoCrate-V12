# AutoCrate Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Auditor:** Quality Assurance Specialist  
**Scope:** Complete codebase security review and GitHub repository analysis

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit of the AutoCrate codebase identified several areas of concern related to security practices, sensitive data exposure, and file management. While no critical security vulnerabilities or hardcoded credentials were found, there are several recommendations to improve the overall security posture of the application.

## Findings

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1.1 File I/O Operations
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** The application performs file write operations using user-provided filenames without comprehensive path validation.

**Location:** 
- `autocrate/nx_expressions_generator.py:1285-1286` - Direct file write with user-controlled filename
- `autocrate/nx_expressions_generator.py:1614` - Output filename construction using user input

**Impact:** Potential for path traversal attacks if malicious input is provided.

**Recommendation:** 
- Implement strict path validation and sanitization
- Use `os.path.abspath()` and validate against allowed directories
- Consider using a whitelist approach for allowed file paths

#### 1.2 Input Validation
**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM

**Issue:** While the application uses tkinter Entry widgets which provide basic input validation, there's no comprehensive server-side validation for numeric inputs.

**Location:** 
- `autocrate/nx_expressions_generator.py:1590-1593` - Direct float conversion of user inputs

**Impact:** Application crashes on invalid input (handled by try-catch but not ideal).

**Recommendation:**
- Implement comprehensive input validation before processing
- Add range checks for all numeric inputs
- Sanitize all user inputs before use

#### 1.3 System Command Execution
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Issue:** Use of `os.system()` command found in security module.

**Location:**
- `security/audit_logger.py:235` - Uses os.system to set file attributes on Windows

**Impact:** Potential command injection if input is not properly sanitized.

**Recommendation:**
- Replace `os.system()` with subprocess module with proper argument escaping
- Use Windows API directly for file attribute changes

### 2. Sensitive Data Exposure

#### 2.1 Personal Information in Git History
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** Email address exposed in git commit history.

**Details:**
- Author email: `curious.antimony@gmail.com` visible in all commits
- Author name: `shivam-bhardwaj` visible in all commits

**Impact:** Personal information exposed publicly if repository is public.

**Recommendation:**
- Consider using a no-reply email address for future commits
- Use `.mailmap` file to anonymize historical commits if needed

#### 2.2 File Path Exposure
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Issue:** Full system paths visible in Claude settings.

**Location:**
- `.claude/settings.local.json:25` - Contains full Windows path with username "Curio"

**Impact:** Reveals system username and directory structure.

**Recommendation:**
- Use relative paths where possible
- Consider environment variables for sensitive paths

### 3. File Management Issues

#### 3.1 Binary Files in Repository
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

**Issue:** CAD/NX part files (.prt) are tracked in git repository.

**Files Found:**
- `nx part files/Klimp steve.prt`
- `nx part files/Klimp.prt`
- `nx part files/Klimp_LEFT.prt`
- `nx part files/Klimp_RIGHT.prt`
- `nx part files/Klimp_TOP.prt`

**Impact:** 
- Binary files bloat repository size
- Potential proprietary design data exposed
- File contains name "steve" which might be personal/internal

**Recommendation:**
- Remove all .prt files from repository using `git rm --cached`
- Add `*.prt` to .gitignore (already present but files were committed before)
- Use Git LFS for large binary files if absolutely necessary

#### 3.2 .gitignore Configuration
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Issue:** While .gitignore is comprehensive, some files were committed before rules were added.

**Recommendation:**
- Clean repository history of unwanted files
- Regularly audit tracked files against .gitignore rules

### 4. Security Configuration

#### 4.1 Development Mode Security
**Risk Level:** LOW (Acceptable for development)

**Issue:** Security features can be disabled via environment variables.

**Location:**
- `config.py:57-60` - Security can be disabled with AUTOCRATE_SKIP_SECURITY
- `config.py:59` - Authentication disabled in development mode

**Impact:** Reduced security in development environments.

**Recommendation:**
- This is acceptable for development but ensure production builds force security
- Add warnings when running with reduced security
- Document security implications clearly

### 5. No Critical Issues Found

**Positive Findings:**
- No hardcoded passwords, API keys, or tokens found
- No database connection strings or credentials
- No private keys or certificates
- No customer data or PII beyond author information
- Security module implements proper authentication and audit logging
- Good separation of development and production configurations

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Remove Binary Files from Repository**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached "nx part files/*.prt"
   git commit -m "Remove binary CAD files from repository"
   ```

2. **Implement Path Validation**
   Add validation function for file operations:
   ```python
   def validate_output_path(filename, allowed_dir):
       abs_path = os.path.abspath(filename)
       if not abs_path.startswith(os.path.abspath(allowed_dir)):
           raise ValueError("Invalid output path")
       return abs_path
   ```

3. **Fix os.system Usage**
   Replace in `security/audit_logger.py:235`:
   ```python
   # Instead of: os.system(f'attrib +h "{key_file}"')
   subprocess.run(['attrib', '+h', key_file], check=True)
   ```

### Medium Priority Actions

1. **Enhance Input Validation**
   - Add comprehensive validation module
   - Implement range checks for all numeric inputs
   - Add input sanitization layer

2. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Replace generic exception catches with specific ones
   - Add proper logging for security events
   - Implement rate limiting for file operations

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Add security guidelines to README
   - Document all environment variables and their impact
   - Create security policy document

### Low Priority Actions

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Add type hints throughout codebase
   - Implement security linting rules
   - Add automated security scanning to CI/CD

2. **Audit Trail Enhancement**
   - Ensure all file operations are logged
   - Add user action tracking
   - Implement log rotation and retention policies

## Compliance Considerations

The application shows good security awareness with:
- Separate security module with authentication and audit logging
- Configurable security levels for different environments
- Windows integration for authentication
- Proper separation of concerns

However, for ASTM compliance and enterprise deployment:
- Implement formal change control procedures
- Add digital signatures for generated files
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add data integrity checks for all calculations

## Conclusion

The AutoCrate codebase demonstrates professional development practices with no critical security vulnerabilities. The main concerns are around file management and the presence of binary files in the repository. The recommended actions will significantly improve the security posture without major architectural changes.

The application is suitable for enterprise deployment with the implementation of the recommended security enhancements, particularly around input validation and file operation security.

**Overall Security Rating:** GOOD (7/10)

The codebase shows security awareness but needs minor improvements for production deployment.
